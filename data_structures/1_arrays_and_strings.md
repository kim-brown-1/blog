# Arrays and strings

An array stores a collection of elements, typically of the same type, in a contiguous block of memory. Elements can be accessed by their index, which is an integer value that represents the position of the element in the array. They can be used to store a variety of data types, including numbers, strings, and objects. Some programming languages, like C and C++, allow arrays to be defined with a fixed size, while others, like Python and JavaScript, have dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.
