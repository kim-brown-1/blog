# Queues 

A queue stores a collection of elements in a specific order. It follows First In First Out (FIFO), meaning that the first element that was added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of people standing in line (known as a "queue" in the UK) and being processed one at a time. 

Common queue operations include:

- Enqueue: adding an element to the end of the queue.
- Dequeue: removing the element from the front of the queue.
- Peek: viewing the front element without removing it.
- Is Empty: checking if the queue is empty.

Queues are commonly used to manage tasks or events. They are also frequently used in algorithms, such as breadth-first search.
