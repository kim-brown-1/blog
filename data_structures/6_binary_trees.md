# Binary trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Each node in a binary tree is also called a parent node and the children as left and right children. Each child node can also have its own left and right children, forming a sub-tree.

A binary tree can have the following types:

- Full binary tree: A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- Complete binary tree: A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level is completely filled, except possibly the last level.
- Perfect binary tree: A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree in which all the leaf nodes are at the same level and this level has the maximum number of nodes.
- Binary trees can be used to implement data structures like:

Heaps
- Searching and sorting algorithms like AVL tree, red-black tree, and so on
- Expression parse trees used in compilers
- Binary trees are also commonly traversed using depth-first and breadth-first traversal techniques, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
