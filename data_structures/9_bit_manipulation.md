# Bit manipulation

## Why do it?

As an early CS student, I had no idea why bit operations were worth learning. Why work with data on the bit level, instead of using language abstractions like usual? 

Then at my first internship I had to use a bitmask to represent some boolean flags in a small message, and I started thinking about this stuff a bit more. The short answer is that they can make code faster and more efficient in certain circumstances, especially when memory is limited. Frequently these are low-level programs, like embedded devices or encryption.

It's also a good in-road to brushing up on (or learning) the fundamentals of how data is represented in memory. While language abstractions are a beautiful thing, understanding the basic building blocks can help us write better code and make sense of things at a deeper level. 

Address space is broken up into bytes (usually 8 bits). So if you want to store the boolean 'true', it will go into one byte - 0000 0001 [1]. That doesn't seem the most efficient, does it?


## Common operators

Note - the shorthand for logical operators (|, &, >>, <<) are based on C/ Python notation. 

- NOT: AKA "bitwise complement", negates each bit. Ex]  ^ "0011 1111" -> "1100 0000"
- AND: Performs **logical AND** on the corresponding bits in two inputs. Ex]  "1111 0000" & "1100 1111" -> "1100 0000"
- OR: Performs **inclusive OR** on corresponding bits.  Ex]  "1111 1100" | "0000 1111" -> "1111 1111"
- XOR: Performs **exclusive OR** on corresponding bits.  Ex] "1111 1100" ^ "0000 1111" -> "1111 0000"


## Arithmetic shift
- Arithemtic shift: bits shifted off the end are gone. 
- Left arithmetic shift: 0's are subbed in on the right end (to replace the # of bits shifted off the left).  Ex] "00010111" << 2 (left shift by two) -> "01011100". A left arithmetic shift by n is equivalent to multiplying by 2^n [2].
- Right arithmetic shift: the previous leftmost digit (AKA the 'sign bit', which determines the sign of the number, positive or negative) is shifted in on the left as the right bits "fall off". This preserves the sign of the number.  Ex] "10010111" >> 1 (right shift by one) -> "11001011"


## Logical shift
- Zeros are subbed in on either end (so left shift is the same for both). Great for unsigned numbers.
