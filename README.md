# Welcome!

I graduated from Brown with a CS degree in May 2021, and am a backend Golang Engineer at **CrowdStrike**. There's always so much learn, especially in the first few years as a dev, and I wanted to document some of my self-study and general career learnings here, for myself and hopefully others!

Currently, I'm reading a few books on distributed systems and system design. I'll organize content as best I can and most importantly include links to the resources that have helped me. There will be links to Quizlet sets, quizzes, and relevant Leetcode problems for each topic. Please feel free to email kim.brown.2442@gmail.com or create a pull request if you'd like to correct anything or contribute to the content.
